This repository gives the verify and gc algorithms of Pedagoguery Software's products (include Poly, Poly Pro, GrafEq and Tess).

## Compile

**CLI version:**  

```
gcc -D_COMPILE_CLI keygen.c
```

**GUI version: **  

To compile GUI version, you should have `Visual Basic 6` environment.  

Then, hook link process and replace the `mdlC.obj` using `keygen.obj`(the object generated by `keygen.c` and should be `coff` format).  

Details: Change `/OPT:REF` to `/OPT:NOREF` and add the `msvcrt.lib` manually. The symbol name of `gen_code` in `keygen.obj` should be changed to `?gen_code@mdlC@@AAGXXZ`.
